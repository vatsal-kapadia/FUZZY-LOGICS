# FUZZY-LOGICS
This is a py code for fuzzy based graphs
Fuzzy set is a mathematical model of vague qualitative or quantitative data frequently generated by means of the natural language. The model is based on the generalization of classical concepts of set & its characteristic function.
Mathematical Formalism:
The traditional deterministic set in a universum µ can be represented by the characteristic fun Ψ.
A mapping µ into two element set {0,1} namely for x€µ .
                     ΨA (x) = 0 if x € A   &
                       Ψ (x) = 1 if x € A   
A fuzzy set of A of µ is defined. By a membership fun. µ A mapping µ into a closed unit interval  [0, 1] where for  x€µ.
                             µ A (x) =  0 if  x € A    &
                             µ A  (x) =  1  if x € A   
                             µ A (x) € (0, 1) if x possibly belongs to A but it is not sure.
For the last case the nearer to 1 the value µ A (x) = 1 is higher is the possibility that  x € A .
Operations with Fuzzy sets:
         The processing of fuzzy sets generalizes the processing of deterministic sets.
Namely if A, B are fuzzy sets with membership functions µ A , µ B respectively, then also the complement Ā, union AuB & intersection A&B are fuzzy sets & their membership functions are defined for x€ µ  by;
µ Ā(x) = 1-  µA(x)
µAuB(x) = max( µA(x), µB(x)),
µAnB(x) = min( µA(x), µB(x))
Moreover the concept of inclusion of fuzzy set AcB is def by;
µA(x) <= µB(x)   for all x€ µ 
 & empty & universal fuzzy sets $ &  µ  are define by membership function. 
µ0(x) =0  & µB(x)=1    for all x € v 
       Even if all above operations and concepts consequently generalize their counterparts in deterministic set theory the resulting properties of fuzziness need not be identical with those of deterministic theory e.g. for sum fuzzy set A the relation   AnĀ ≠ ф or even  AcĀ may be fulfilled.

Here I have created graphs for temperature,weather and motor speed.
